# ArticleManagementSystem
A sample web API using the GO language

To run the server simply type the "go run ." command in terminal
The server will start on the default address: 0.0.0.0:9090

To register a user, POST a request via 0.0.0.0:9090\signup with JSON body like below
     
        {
            "Email": "mohy66@gmail.com",
            "password": "123"
        }

to sign in with the user also POST a request via 0.0.0.0:9090\login with JSON body like below
       
        {
            "Email": "mohy66@gmail.com",
            "password": "123"
        }

This web server uses JSON Web Token(JWT) authentication, so after successfully logging in you will receive an access token and refresh token related to your username in response.

You should pass the Access Token in each request Authorization Header with "Bearer Token" format to the server to verify your identity, otherwise, you will receive an "Authentication failed. Invalid token‚Äù message in response.

Note that for security reasons after a specific time(default:120min) this access token will expire and you need to request a new access token by calling GET request 0.0.0.0:9090\refresh-token and passing the given refresh token as "Bearer Token" in the Authorization Header
